I'm Benjamin Smithynunta, a computer science student at Oregon State University. (i got an A- in algorithms and 100% OS maybe im kinda cracked at school)
I like exploring new technologies too.
Some projects I've built have been related to the rhythm game osu! or to solve pain points with video editing workflows.
